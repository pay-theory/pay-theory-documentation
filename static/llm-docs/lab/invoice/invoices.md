## Type Definitions

### SqlQuery

Here we will detail how you can build your own queries to pass into the Pay Theory API.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `query_list` | `[QueryPair]` | A list of query pairs used to build out a query. See type definition: QueryPair. |
| `sort_list` | `[SortPair]` | A list of sort pairs to define how the data should be sorted. See type definition: SortPair. |

### QueryPair

A query pair is the object to build out a query. There are some required fields and some optional fields.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `conjunctive_operator` | `ConjunctiveOperator` | The conjunctive operator to use to connect the query pair with the next query pair. More detail below. See type definition: ConjunctiveOperator. |
| `in_values` | `[String]` | A list of values to compare the data to. This should be used instead of value if using the operators IN or NOT_IN. |
| `key` | `String` | The key to the value you want to query against. |
| `operator` | `Operator` | The operator to use to compare the value to the data you are calling. More detail below. See type definition: Operator. |

| `value` | `String` | The value to compare the data to. If using the LIKE or NOT_LIKE operator, this value can contain wildcard characters. |

### ConjunctiveOperator

These operators are case-sensitive. Conjunctive operators in the same array must match for a query to work. To mix operators use nested queries with query pairs containing a query_list. The following are the available conjunctive operators:

| ConjunctiveOperator Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `AND_NEXT` | The results of the query have to meet all the conditions in the query pair list. |
| `NONE_NEXT` | The final query pair in the list should use this operator since it has nothing to connect to. |
| `OR_NEXT` | The results of the query have to meet one of the conditions in the query pair list. |

### Operator

These operators are case-sensitive. The following are the available operators:

| Operator Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `EQUAL` | The data is equal to the value. |
| `EQUAL_FALSE` | The data is false. |
| `EQUAL_TRUE` | The data is true. |
| `GREATER_EQUAL` | The data is greater than or equal to the value. |
| `GREATER_THAN` | The data is greater than the value. |
| `IN_LIST` | The data is in the list of values. |
| `IS_NOT_NULL` | The data is not null. |
| `IS_NULL` | The data is null. |
| `LESS_EQUAL` | The data is less than or equal to the value. |
| `LESS_THAN` | The data is less than the value. |
| `LIKE` | The data is like the value. The value can contain wildcard characters. |
| `NOT_EQUAL` | The data is not equal to the value. |
| `NOT_IN_LIST` | The data is not in the list of values. |
| `NOT_LIKE` | The data is not like the value. The value can contain wildcard characters. |
