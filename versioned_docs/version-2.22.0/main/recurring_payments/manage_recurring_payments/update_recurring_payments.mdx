# Update Recurring Payment
Updating recurring payments allows modifications to payment details, intervals, or amounts for ongoing subscriptions or services. This guide refers to making changes to the specifics of an already-existing regular payment plan, including altering the amounts, intervals, or related data.

:::tip Tip
Updating an invoice can be used to update a payment method and catch up on any missed payments caused by an invalid payment method. If you want to update any other fields, you will need to cancel the recurring payment and create a new one.
