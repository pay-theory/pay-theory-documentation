# Get Missed Recurring Payment Data
By following this guide you will learn how to obtain the total amount of payments due as well as the number of missed payments.


## Obtain Missed Recurring Payment Information
This is useful if you want to charge a customer for all missed payments at once when updating their payment method. This will query how many payments have been missed and the total amount of those payments.

```graphql
{
    query missedRecurringPaymentData(recurring_id: String) {
        fee
        number_of_payments_missed
        total_amount_owed
    }
}
```

### Required Arguments
|Key                |type         |       description                     |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|     
| recurring_id            |string        |The recurring_id of the recurring payment to be retired.|
|fee            |int  | If the recurring payment has fee_mode set to SERVICE_FEE, this will be the total amount of fees that will be charged to the customer to pay off the missed payments. If the recurring payment has fee_mode set to MERCHANT_FEE, this will be 0.|
|number_of_payments_missed| int             |The number of payments that have been missed.|
|total_amount_owed         | int        |The total amount that the customer will owe to pay off the missed payments.|

## Returns
The information from this call will include the amount the consumer needs to make up for missing payments for a recurring payment option.

```JSON
{
    "data": {
        "missedRecurringPaymentData": {
            "fee": int,
            "number_of_payments_missed": int,
            "total_amount_owed": int
        }
    }
}

```
