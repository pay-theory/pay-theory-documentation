# Get Missed Recurring Payment Data
Retrieving missed recurring payment data allows tracking of failed transactions or missed payments within a subscription or service. By following this guide you will learn how to obtain the total amount of payments due as well as the number of missed payments.


## Request
This is useful if you want to charge a customer for all missed payments at once when updating their payment method. This will query how many payments have been missed and the total amount of those payments.

```graphql title="GraphQL"
{
    query missedRecurringPaymentData(
        recurring_id: "" # Insert recurring_id
    ) 
    {
        fee
        number_of_payments_missed
        total_amount_owed
    }
}
```
