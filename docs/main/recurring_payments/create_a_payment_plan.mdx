# Making a Recurring payment
Recurring payments are any repeating transactions that are completed on a periodic basis, such as a car loan, or mortgage. This guide will walk you through how to make a recurring payment plan.

## Create a payment plan
A recurring payment represents a payment that will trigger on an interval. You can create a recurring payment with a set number of payments to enable a payment plan for a payor.

```graphql title="GraphQL"
mutation {
  createRecurringPayment(input: {
            amount: 10000,
            payment_count: Int
            merchant_uid: String, 
            payment_interval: MONTHLY,
            payment_method_id: "", # Put the payment method id here
            recurring_name: "Tech Fees",
            payor: {
                full_name: "Justice Howard",
                email: "justice_howard@justice_howard.io"
            }
        }) {
 amount_per_payment
 fee_mode
 fee_per_payment
 next_payment_date
 payment_interval
 recurring_id
 remaining_payments
 statuts
}

}
