# Create a Payment Plan
Recurring payments are any repeating transactions that are completed on a periodic basis, such as a car loan, or mortgage. This guide will walk you through how to make a recurring payment plan.

## Request
In the following example Pat Johnson purchassed a lawn mower for $1000.00. However he was unable to make the entire payment so he opted for a payment plan. In this example, his total payment of $1000.00 will be split up into 10 payments of $100.00. The payments will be collected from Pat Johnson's tokenized payment method every month, and will continue until the all 10 payments are complete.

```graphql title="GraphQL"
mutation {
  createRecurringPayment(input: {
            amount: 10000,  # Amount in pennies
            payment_count: 10, 
            merchant_uid: "", # Insert merchant_uid
            payment_interval: MONTHLY, 
            payment_method_id: "", # Insert tokenized payment method
            recurring_name: "Lawn Mower",
            payor: {
                full_name: "Pat Johnson",
                email: "patjohnson@pat_johnson.io"
            }
        }) {
 amount_per_payment
 payment_interval
 recurring_id
 remaining_payments
}

}
