# Custom Query
We will go over how to create custom queries that you may submit to the Pay Theory API in this section.
Let's examine a fundamental query object first, and then we will dissect it.

```graphql title="GraphQL"
{
    query_list: [
        {
            key: "full_name",
            value: "John Doe",
            operator: EQUAL,
            conjunctive_operator: NONE_NEXT
        }
    ], 
    sort_list: {
        direction: ASC, 
        key: "transfer_date"
    }
}
```

## Query Pair
A list of query pairs can be used to build out a query.

#### Required Arguments
The following parameter must be used in order to use a query pair while writing a GraphQL query.

|Key                |type         |       description                     |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|     
|key            |string        |The key to the value you want to query against.|
|operator        | operator    |The operator to use to compare the value to the data you are calling. More detail below.|


#### Optional Arguments
The parameters listed below provide flexibility in query result customization but are not required in query pair.

|Key                |type         |       description                     |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|     
|conjunctive_operator | ConjunctiveOperator    | The conjunctive operator to use to connect the query pair with the next query pair. More detail below.|
|in_values          |string        |A list of values to compare the data to. This should be used instead of `value` if using the operators `IN_LIST` or `NOT_IN_LIST`.|
|query_group            |QueryPairs | A list of query pairs to use to build out a nested query. A more detailed example is below under the examples section.|
|value            |string |The value to compare the data to. If using the LIKE or NOT_LIKE operator, this value can contain wildcard characters.|



      ### Operators
These operators are case-sensitive. The following are the available operators:

|Type               |       description                     |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|     
|EQUAL              | The value of the data must be equal to the value in the query pair.|
|EQUAL_FALSE        | The value of the data must be equal to False.|
|EQUAL_TRUE         | The value of the data must be equal to True.|
|GREATER_EQUAL      | The value of the data must be greater than or equal to the value in the query pair.|
|GREATER_THAN       | The value of the data must be greater than the value in the query pair.|
|IN_LIST            | The value of the data must be in the list of in_values in the query pair.|
|IS_NOT_NULL        | The value of the data must not be null.|
|IS_NULL            | The value of the data must be null.|
|LESS_EQUAL         | The value of the data must be less than or equal to the value in the query pair.|
|LESS_THAN          | The value of the data must be less than the value in the query pair.|
|LIKE               | The data is like the value. The value can contain wildcard characters like %,[],-,{},_,^. |
|NOT_EQUAL          | The value of the data must not be equal to the value in the query pair.|
|NOT_IN_LIST        | The value of the data must not be in the list of in_values in the query pair.|
|NOT_LIKE           | The data is not like the value. The value can contain wildcard characters like %,[],-,{},_,^. |


### Conjunctive Operators
These operators are case-sensitive. Conjunctive operators in the same array must match for a query to work. To mix operators use nested queries with query pairs containing a `query_list`. The following are the available conjunctive operators:

|Type               |       description                     |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|     
|AND_NEXT           | The results of the query have to meet all the conditions in the query pair list.|
|OR_NEXT            | The results of the query have to meet one of the conditions in the query pair list.  |
|NONE_NEXT          | The final query pair in the list should use this operator since it has nothing to connect to. |

### Sort Pair
A sort pair is the object used to tell a query how the data should be sorted.

|Key                |type         |       description                     |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|     
|direction          |SortDirection       |The direction to sort the data. These are case-sensitive.<ul><li>`ASC`: Begins with the least or smallest and ends with the greatest or largest.</li><li>`DESC`: Begins with the greatest or largest and ends with the least or smallest.</li></ul>|
|key             | string    | The key to sort the data by.|

## Examples
The following examples provide a quick rundown of how the query functions in the payment transaction.

#### 1. Transactions With Status SETTLED and the reference starts with `test`.
   If you wanted to build a query that looks for any transactions that has a status of SETTLED and the reference starts with test, you would do the following.

   This query would return only those transactions where the status is `SETTLED` and the reference is `test`.
    ```graphql title="GraphQL"
    {
    transactions(limit: 5, query: {query_list: [
    {
        key: "reference",
        value: "test%",
        operator: LIKE,
        conjunctive_operator: AND_NEXT
    },
    {
        key: "status",
        value: "SETTLED",
        operator: EQUAL,
        conjunctive_operator: NONE_NEXT
    }
    ]}) 
    {
        items {
            transaction_id
            reference
            gross_amount
        }
        total_row_count
    }
    }

    ```

#### 2. Querying Sub Objects
    Payment method is a nested data object. Because of this, payment method queries can be made by passing a separate array of query pairs for the metadata.


    This following will return 10 transactions where the `gross_amount` is greater than 1000 and the payment has a payment method in which the `last_four` is equal to 1234. It would be sorted by gross_amount in ascending order.

    ```graphql title="GraphQL"
    {
	    transactions(limit: 10, query:{
            query_list: [
			    {
                    key: "gross_amount",
                    value: "1000",
                    operator: GREATER_THAN,
                    conjunctive_operator: NONE_NEXT
                }
            ],
            sort_pair: [{
                direction: ASC,
                key: "gross_amount"
            }]
        } 
        )
	    {
        items {
            currency
            gross_amount
            payment_method(query_list: [{
                key: "last_four",
                value: "1234",
                operator: EQUAL
            }])
        }
        total_row_count
        }
    }
    ```
