# Query Settlement Data
Settlements are a batch of payments, disputes, and refunds that are grouped together and paid out to a merchant. This guide will walk you through how to write a query for a settlement.

```graphql title="GraphQL"
query GetSettlement{
    settlements(limit: 10, direction: FORWARD, offset: "", offset_id: "", query:{
        query_list:[
            {
                key: "status",
                value: "SUCCEEDED",
                operator : EQUAL
            }
        ]
    }) {
        items {
            gross_amount
            merchant_uid
            settlement_batch
            status
            transaction_debit_count
            transaction_reversal_count
        }
    }
}

```
