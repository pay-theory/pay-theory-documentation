# Create an Invoice
Invoices are used to create a payment request that can be sent to a payor. This guide will walk you through how to create an invoice.

```graphql
mutation {
    createInvoice(input:{
        invoice_amount: int,
        currency:string,
        merchant_uid: string,
        payor_id: string
    }){
        due_by
        fee_mode
        invoice_id
        invoice_description
        invoice_name
    }
}

```

## Required Arguments
