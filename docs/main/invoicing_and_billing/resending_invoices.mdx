# Invoice
Invoices are used to create a payment request that can be sent to a payor. This guide will walk you through how to create, update and delete an invoice.

## Create an Invoice
An invoice helps in providing the essential details regarding the services rendered, their associated costs, and the terms of payment, allowing for effective billing procedures.

```graphql
mutation {
    createInvoice(input:{
        invoice_amount: int,
        currency:string,
        merchant_uid: string,
        payor_id: string
    }){
        due_by
        fee_mode
        invoice_id
        invoice_description
        invoice_name
    }
}

```

### Required Arguments
To create an invoice, you need to send a request. The following parameters must be used in order to create an invoice successfully. The query may fail to execute if any parameter is omitted, in which case the required data for processing will need to be requested.

|Key                |type         |       description                     |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|

| payor_id  |string    |The Pay Theory unique identifier for the payor that the invoice belongs to.|

### Optional Arguments

|---------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|    
| due_by      |string     | The date that the payor is expected to pay the invoice by.|
| fee_mode          |FeeMode     |The fee mode that will be used on that transaction when a payment is made through Pay Theory's hosted checkout. It can be one of the following: <ul><li>MERCHANT_FEE=''</li><li>SERVICE_FEE=''</li></ul>|
| invoice_description        |string     | A brief description of the invoice. This will show up on the hosted checkout page and any email communications about the Invoice.|
