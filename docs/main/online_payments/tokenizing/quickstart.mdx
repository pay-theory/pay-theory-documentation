## Run tokenization method
This function is used to tokenize a card or bank account. For further transactions, this token may be used in place of the real payment information, lowering the risk involved with keeping and transferring sensitive data.
```jsx title="javascript"
// optionally provide details about the payor
const PAYOR_INFO = {
  "first_name": "Some",
  "last_name": "Body",
  "email": "somebody@gmail.com",
  }
const TOKENIZE_PAYMENT_METHOD_PARAMETERS = {
  payorInfo: PAYOR_INFO, // optional
}

paytheory.tokenizePaymentMethod(TOKENIZE_PAYMENT_METHOD_PARAMETERS)
```
### Optional values that can be passed into your payment method token
These are the values that you can pass into the tokenizePaymentMethod function to tokenize a card or bank account.

|Key                |type               |description                                               |
--------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|     
| payorInfo         |object             |see the Payor Info object below for details|
| billingInfo       |object             |see the Billing Info object below for details. This is required if you are not using the zip hosted field.|
| metadata          |object             |An object that will be stored with the token and can be used to track the token.|
|  payorId          |string             |<ul><li>The Pay Theory payor ID to use for the payment. Allows for user to manage identities.</li><li>This cannot be used if also using the payorInfo parameter.</li></ul>|

The function returns a Promise that will contain an object with a key of `type`. You can expect the following values for type.

### Promise return type and expected values
|Type               |Description                                            |
--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| TOKENIZED         |The payment method was tokenized successfully and the token will be in the body key.|
|  ERROR            |The transact call had an error while processing and the error details will be in the error key.|

After the payment is successful you can see the token has been generated and this is how the body looks.
