## Transaction Status

- `PENDING` - The transaction is pending capture. For a sale this automatically changes to `SUCCEEDED` typically within the hour. For an auth that has been set to capture, this will change to `SUCCEEDED` when the settlement batch is created.

- `FAILED` - The transaction failed to authorize.
- `SETTLED` - The transaction has been settled.
- `REFUNDED` - The transaction has been refunded.
- `PARTIALLY_REFUNDED` - The transaction has been refunded for a portion of the amount.
- `VOIDED` - The transaction has been voided which means it was never captured and will not be settled.
- `RETURNED` - The transaction is an ACH transaction that has had an `ACH_RETURN` created for it.

***
## Transaction Type

- `ACH_RETURN` - The transaction is an ACH return for an ACH Debit or Reversal. Check `parent_id` to find origin.
- `DEBIT` - The transaction is a debit to a payors payment method.
- `FAILURE` - The transaction is a failed debit to a payors payment method.
- `REVERSAL` - The transaction is a reversal on a debit to a payors payment method. Check `parent_id` to find origin.

**Arguments**

|Key                |type         |       description                     |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|     
|direction          |MoveDirection|The direction of the pagination. Makes sure the results are returned in the correct order.|
|limit              |Int          |The number of transactions to return.|
|offset             |String       |The value of the offset item for which the list is being sorted.|

|query              |QueryObject  |The query to filter the transactions with based on Pay Theory defined data. Detailed information about the query object can be found [here](query).|

**Nested Queries**  
Transactions can also be filtered by passing a query_list to the metadata, payment method, or payor tied to the payment method.

This will only return Transactions that have Metadata, Payment Methods, or Payors that match these queries.  Detailed information about the query list can be found [here](query).
