# Address Class

The `Address` structure in the Pay Theory SDK represents a physical address. It is used to store and manage address information, including street lines, city, country, region, and postal code.

## Overview

`Address` is a Swift structure that conforms to the `Codable` and `Equatable` protocols. It provides a standardized way to handle address information across the Pay Theory SDK.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| city | String? | The city of the address. |
| country | String? | The country of the address. |
| region | String? | The region (state or province) of the address. Limited to 2 characters. |
| line1 | String? | The first line of the street address. |
| line2 | String? | The second line of the street address (optional). |
| postalCode | String? | The postal code (ZIP code) of the address. |

## Initializer

```swift
public init(line1: String? = nil,
            line2: String? = nil,
            city: String? = nil,
            country: String? = nil,
            region: String? = nil,
            postalCode: String? = nil)
```

Creates a new `Address` instance.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| line1 | String? | The first line of the street address. |
| line2 | String? | The second line of the street address (if applicable). |
| city | String? | The city of the address. |
| country | String? | The country of the address. |
| region | String? | The region (state or province) of the address. Limited to 2 characters. |
| postalCode | String? | The postal code (ZIP code) of the address. |

## Usage Example

```swift
let address = Address(
    line1: "123 Main St",
    line2: "Apt 4B",
    city: "Anytown",
    country: "USA",
    region: "CA",
    postalCode: "12345"
)

// Accessing properties
print(address.city ?? "") // Outputs: Anytown
print(address.region ?? "") // Outputs: CA

// Updating properties
var mutableAddress = address
mutableAddress.postalCode = "54321"
```

## Special Considerations

### Region Property

The `region` property is constrained to a maximum of 2 characters. If a value longer than 2 characters is assigned, it will retain the previous value.

```swift
var address = Address()
address.region = "California" // This will not be set
print(address.region ?? "") // Outputs: ""

address.region = "CA" // This will be set
print(address.region ?? "") // Outputs: "CA"
```
