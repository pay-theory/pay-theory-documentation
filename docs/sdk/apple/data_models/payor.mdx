The `Payor` structure in the Pay Theory SDK represents an individual who is making a payment. It encapsulates personal details and address information of the payor.

## Overview

| lastName | String? | The last name of the payor. |
| email | String? | The email address of the payor. |
| personalAddress | Address | The personal address of the payor. |

## Initializer

```swift
public init(firstName: String? = nil,
            lastName: String? = nil,
            email: String? = nil,
            phone: String? = nil,
            personalAddress: Address = Address())
```

    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
    phone: "1234567890",

print(payor.personalAddress.city ?? "") // Outputs: Anytown

// Updating properties
var mutablePayor = payor
mutablePayor.email = "newemail@example.com"
```

## Methods
