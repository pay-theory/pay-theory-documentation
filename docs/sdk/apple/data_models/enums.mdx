# Pay Theory Enum Documentation

This document provides an overview of three important enumerations used in the Pay Theory SDK: `PAYMENT_TYPE`, `FEE_MODE`, and `HealthExpenseType`. These enums are crucial for specifying payment methods, fee structures, and health expense categories in various SDK operations.

## PaymentType

The `PaymentType` enum represents the different payment methods supported by the Pay Theory SDK.

```swift
public enum PaymentType: String, CaseIterable, Identifiable {
    case card
    case ach
    case cash

    public var id: Self { self }
}
```

### Cases

| Case | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `card` | Represents credit or debit card payments. |
| `ach` | Represents Automated Clearing House (bank transfer) payments. |
| `cash` | Represents cash payments (typically used with barcode generation for in-person payments). |

### Usage

```swift
// Example: Specifying a card payment in a transaction
payTheory.transact(amount: 1000, paymentMethod: .card) { response in
    // Handle transaction response
}
```

## FeeMode

The `FeeMode` enum defines how transaction fees are handled in the Pay Theory system.

```swift
public enum FeeMode: String, Codable {
    case merchantFee
    case serviceFee
}
```

### Cases

| Case | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `merchantFee` | The merchant absorbs the transaction fee. The customer pays only the transaction amount. |
| `serviceFee` | The customer pays the transaction fee in addition to the transaction amount. |

### Usage

```swift
// Example: Setting up a transaction with a service fee
payTheory.transact(amount: 1000,
                   paymentMethod: .card,
                   fee: 50,
                   feeMode: .serviceFee) { response in
    // Handle transaction response
}
```

## HealthExpenseType

The `HealthExpenseType` enum categorizes health-related expenses, which can be important for certain types of health savings accounts or flexible spending accounts.

```swift
public enum HealthExpenseType: String, Codable {
    case healthcare
    case perscription
    case vision
    case clinical
    case copay
    case dental
    case transit
}
```

### Cases

| Case           | Description                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `medical`      | Represents general medical expenses.                        |
| `perscription` | Represents prescription medication expenses.                |
| `vision`       | Represents vision-related expenses.                         |
| `clinical`     | Represents clinical expenses.                               |
| `copay`        | Represents copayments for medical services.                 |
| `dental`       | Represents dental expenses.                                 |
| `transit`      | Represents transportation expenses related to medical care. |


### Usage

```swift
// Example: Processing a medical expense transaction
payTheory.transact(amount: 15000,
                   paymentMethod: .card,
                   healthExpenseType: .medical) { response in
    // Handle transaction response
}
```
