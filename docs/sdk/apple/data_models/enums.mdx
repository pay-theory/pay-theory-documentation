# Pay Theory Enum Documentation

This document provides an overview of three important enumerations used in the Pay Theory SDK: `PAYMENT_TYPE`, `FEE_MODE`, and `HealthExpenseType`. These enums are crucial for specifying payment methods, fee structures, and health expense categories in various SDK operations.

## PaymentType

The `PaymentType` enum represents the different payment methods supported by the Pay Theory SDK.

```swift
public enum PaymentType: String, CaseIterable, Identifiable {
    case CARD
    case ACH
    case CASH

    public var id: Self { self }
}
```

### Cases

| Case | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `CARD` | Represents credit or debit card payments. |
| `ACH` | Represents Automated Clearing House (bank transfer) payments. |
| `CASH` | Represents cash payments (typically used with barcode generation for in-person payments). |

### Usage

```swift
// Example: Specifying a card payment in a transaction
payTheory.transact(amount: 1000, paymentMethod: .CARD) { response in
    // Handle transaction response
}
```

## FeeMode

The `FeeMode` enum defines how transaction fees are handled in the Pay Theory system.

```swift
public enum FEE_MODE: String, Codable {
    case MERCHANT_FEE
    case SERVICE_FEE
}
```

### Cases

| Case | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `MERCHANT_FEE` | The merchant absorbs the transaction fee. The customer pays only the transaction amount. |
| `SERVICE_FEE` | The customer pays the transaction fee in addition to the transaction amount. |

### Usage

```swift
// Example: Setting up a transaction with a service fee
payTheory.transact(amount: 1000,
                   paymentMethod: .CARD,
                   fee: 50,
                   feeMode: .SERVICE_FEE) { response in
    // Handle transaction response
}
```

## HealthExpenseType

The `HealthExpenseType` enum categorizes health-related expenses, which can be important for certain types of health savings accounts or flexible spending accounts.

```swift
public enum HealthExpenseType: String, Codable {
    case MEDICAL
    case DENTAL
    case VISION
    case PRESCRIPTION
    case HEARING
    case TRANSIT
    case PARKING
    case UNREIMBURSED
}
```

### Cases

| Case | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `MEDICAL` | General medical expenses |
| `DENTAL` | Dental care expenses |
| `VISION` | Vision care expenses |
| `PRESCRIPTION` | Prescription medication expenses |
| `HEARING` | Hearing-related medical expenses |
| `TRANSIT` | Health-related transit expenses |
| `PARKING` | Health-related parking expenses |
| `UNREIMBURSED` | Unreimbursed medical expenses |

### Usage

```swift
// Example: Processing a medical expense transaction
payTheory.transact(amount: 15000,
                   paymentMethod: .CARD,
                   healthExpenseType: .MEDICAL) { response in
    // Handle transaction response
}
```
