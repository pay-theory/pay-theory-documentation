# Level3DataSummary Class

The `Level3DataSummary` structure in the Pay Theory SDK represents detailed information about a transaction, typically used in business-to-business or government purchases. It encapsulates various aspects of the transaction such as tax information, purchase identifiers, and shipping details.

## Overview

`Level3DataSummary` is a Swift structure that conforms to the `Encodable` protocol. It provides a standardized way to handle Level 3 data across the Pay Theory SDK.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| taxAmt | Int? | The tax amount for the transaction in cents. |
| taxInd | TaxIndicatorType? | The tax indicator type for the transaction. |
| purchIdfr | String? | A unique identifier for the purchase. |
| orderNum | String? | The order number associated with the transaction. |
| discntAmt | Int? | The discount amount applied to the transaction in cents. |
| frghtAmt | Int? | The freight amount for the transaction in cents. |
| dutyAmt | Int? | The duty amount for the transaction in cents, if applicable. |
| destPostalCode | String? | The destination postal code for the shipment. |
| prodDesc | [String]? | An array of product descriptions related to the transaction. |

## TaxIndicatorType Enum

```swift
public enum TaxIndicatorType: String, Encodable {
    case taxAmountProvided = "TAX_AMOUNT_PROVIDED"
    case notTaxable = "NOT_TAXABLE"
    case noTaxInfoProvided = "NO_TAX_INFO_PROVIDED"
}
```

## Initializer

```swift
public init(taxAmt: Int? = nil,
            taxInd: TaxIndicatorType? = nil,
            purchIdfr: String? = nil,
            orderNum: String? = nil,
            discntAmt: Int? = nil,
            frghtAmt: Int? = nil,
            dutyAmt: Int? = nil,
            destPostalCode: String? = nil,
            prodDesc: [String]? = nil)
```

Creates a new `Level3DataSummary` instance.

## Usage Example

```swift
let level3Data = Level3DataSummary(
    taxAmt: 1050, // $10.50 in cents
    taxInd: .taxAmountProvided,
    purchIdfr: "PUR-12345",
    orderNum: "ORD-6789",
    discntAmt: 500, // $5.00 in cents
    frghtAmt: 1500, // $15.00 in cents
    destPostalCode: "12345",
    prodDesc: ["Widget A", "Gadget B"]
)

// Accessing properties
print(level3Data.taxAmt ?? 0) // Outputs: 1050
print(level3Data.taxInd?.rawValue ?? "") // Outputs: "TAX_AMOUNT_PROVIDED"
```

## Integration with Pay Theory SDK

The `Level3DataSummary` structure is typically used when processing card transactions, especially for business-to-business or government purchases:

```swift
let level3Data = Level3DataSummary(
    taxAmt: 1050, // $10.50 in cents
    taxInd: .taxAmountProvided,
    purchIdfr: "PUR-12345",
    orderNum: "ORD-6789"
)

payTheory.transact(
    amount: 100000, // $1000.00 in cents
    paymentMethod: .CARD,
    level3DataSummary: level3Data
) { response in
    // Handle transaction response
}
```

By providing Level 3 data, you may qualify for better interchange rates and provide more detailed transaction information, which can be beneficial for reporting and reconciliation purposes.
