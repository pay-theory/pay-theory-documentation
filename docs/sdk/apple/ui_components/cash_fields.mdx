# Pay Theory Cash UI Fields

This documentation covers the SwiftUI views provided by the Pay Theory SDK for capturing cash payment information. These views are designed to be used within a `PTForm` and require a `PayTheory` object to be provided as an environment object.

## Common Requirements

All of these views:
- Must be used within a `PTForm` view hierarchy
- Require a `PayTheory` object to be provided as an environment object
- Automatically handle data binding and validation with the Pay Theory SDK

## PTCashName

A SwiftUI view that provides a text field for capturing the name of the person making the cash payment.

### Usage

```swift
PTCashName(placeholder: "Full Name")
```

### Properties

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| placeholder | String | "Full Name" | The placeholder text displayed when the field is empty |

## PTCashContact

A SwiftUI view that provides a text field for capturing the contact information (phone or email) of the person making the cash payment.

### Usage

```swift
PTCashContact(placeholder: "Phone or Email")
```

### Properties

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| placeholder | String | "Phone or Email" | The placeholder text displayed when the field is empty |

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use these fields together within a `PTForm`:

```swift
struct CashPaymentView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var payTheory: PayTheory

    var body: some View {
        PTForm {
            VStack(spacing: 20) {
                PTCashName()
                PTCashContact()
                // Add other UI elements as needed, such as amount display or submit button
            }
        }
        .environmentObject(payTheory)
    }
}
```

This example creates a cash payment form using the available cash UI fields. Remember to provide the `PayTheory` object as an environment object to the `PTForm` for proper functionality.
