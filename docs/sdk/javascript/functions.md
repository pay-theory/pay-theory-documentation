# Functions

The Pay Theory SDK provides a set of functions that can be used to perform actions in tandem with the Hosted Fields.

***
## payTheoryFields

This function is used to initialize the Pay Theory Hosted Fields.

```javascript
paytheory.payTheoryFields({
  apiKey: string,
  styles: StyleObject,
  placeholders: PlaceholderObject
})
```

These are the parameters that you can pass into the `payTheoryFields` function to customize the Hosted Fields.

The function returns a Promise that will contain an object with a key of `type`. You can expect the following values for `type`:
- [`SUCCESS`](#success-response): The transaction was successful and the transaction details will be in the `body` key.
- [`FAILED`](#failed-response): The transaction failed and the details will be in the `body` key.
- [`CONFIRMATION`](#confirmation-response): The transaction requires confirmation and the transaction details will be in the `body` key.
- [`CASH`](#cash-response): The transact call successfully generated a barcode and the barcode details will be in the `body` key.
- [`ERROR`](#error-response): The transact call had an error while processing and the error details will be in the `error` key.

While generating the Barcode it will use the geoloaction to return a map url for the users specific location.

If this is the first time it has been requested the user will have the opportunity to accept or decline the request.

***
## confirm

This function is used to confirm a payment that has been created and required the confirmation step.

```javascript
paytheory.confirm()
```

The function returns a Promise that will contain an object with a key of `type`. You can expect the following values for `type`:
- [`SUCCESS`](#success-response): The transaction was successful and the transaction details will be in the `body` key.
- [`FAILED`](#failed-response): The transaction failed and the details will be in the `body` key.
- [`ERROR`](#error-response): The transact call had an error while processing and the error details will be in the `error` key.

***
## cancel

This function is used to cancel a payment that has been created and required the confirmation step.

```javascript
paytheory.cancel()
```

The function returns a Promise that will contain `true` if the transaction was cancelled successfully or an [`ERROR`](#error-response) Response.

Once you click cancel the transaction will be cancelled, and you will be able to run `transact` again.
